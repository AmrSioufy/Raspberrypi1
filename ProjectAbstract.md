The project demonstrates the Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) technology as a communication technique to be used in an Intelligent Transportation System. With such a system, a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication and Vehicle-to-infrastructure communication (V2I) are the main concept of wireless communication using DSRC in which one vehicle can exchange real-time information about speed, location and direction with other vehicles around it and with infrastructure units such as traffic lights/roadside units. which allows for use of different applications such as Traffic Management, Collision Avoidance and Toll Collection.
