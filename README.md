# This Reporsitory highlights the Collision Avoidance System application, part of my Graduation Project #
## The below explanation is about the workstation in RaspberryPi directories in the Collision Avoidance System ##

- car_run.py > is the script that runs the car and processes data from distance sensor, stores car speed. based on that data decision is taken for different scenarios

- transmit.sh > transmits a file to a user in the same network using secure copy. 
### To transmit a file you need to specify (Desitnation IP Address, Destination path, Destination username, Destination password, Path of transmitted files)

- Transmit.py > runs all scripts in a loop and continously sending a file to a user using transmit.sh

- ultrasonic.py > distance sensor script
### After reading the sensor readings, data is stored in a text file to be fetched later for a decision inside the "car_run.py"

*Every sensor script exports the data to a txt file which will be imported to the car_run.py for the buildup scenarios*
